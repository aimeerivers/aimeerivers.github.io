It's been over a year since gave up on Facebook and started dabbling in the Fediverse. After the initial excitement of talking to myself on two different Mastodon instances, trying out Pixelfed and PeerTube, and setting up a federated blog, i soon became bored because nobody i knew had yet come across to the distributed way of doing things.

And so i pretty much ignored the entire thing, until a few weeks ago when Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44bn and promptly set about to destroy it. Suddenly loads of my friends on the birdapp were talking about Mastodon, sharing their new identities even though they hadn't posted anything yet, and asking me what mine was.

So it felt like a good time to come back to it. I tidied up my Mastodon profile, added a verified link to my website, installed a new app: MetaText is so much nicer than the standard Mastodon app. And i sort of just started posting again.

Slowly and surely, some of my friends also started posting. I've had meaningful replies and conversations! Even mainstream media is now talking about Mastodon! It looks like this thing is actually happening for real. And it's all thanks to Elon Musk!

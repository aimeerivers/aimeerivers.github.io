## Summary

This crochet dog ball is made in amigurumi style, with (US) single crochets worked spirals. You will need to work quite tight to make the ball safe for dogs to chew on.

My dog absolutely loves these balls! They're soft and fun to throw around. They are so light, they won't damage anything in the home.

# Blog Post Rules

## Writing Style Guidelines

Based on analysis of your blog posts, follow these writing style guidelines when helping with content creation:

### Tone and Voice

- Use a casual, approachable tone that feels conversational
- Write in first person ("I", "my") when describing personal experiences or projects
- Be humble and self-aware - acknowledge when you're late to trends or when things don't go perfectly
- Include personal anecdotes and real-world context

### Structure and Organization

- Start posts with clear, descriptive titles that explain what the post is about
- Use descriptive section headers (## format) to break up content logically
- Include a brief introduction that sets context and explains what you're trying to achieve
- End with conclusions or reflections on what you learned
- **For tutorials, structure as: Problem → Solution → How It Works → Benefits → Questions**

### Technical Writing Style

- Explain technical concepts in accessible language
- Include version numbers and specific details when they matter
- Provide step-by-step instructions for tutorials
- Include code examples in proper markdown code blocks with language specification
- Mention tools, libraries, and dependencies explicitly

### Content Patterns

- Include "You will need" sections for tutorial posts
- Add image descriptions and captions that are informative
- Include links to relevant resources, GitHub repos, and external tools
- Share both successes and failures/challenges honestly
- Provide working examples or demos when possible
- **Add assumption notes** at the top of technical posts (e.g., "This post assumes you're using...")
- **Include FAQ/Questions sections** for complex tutorials to address practical concerns
- **Add contact information** at the end encouraging readers to share experiences

### Language and Grammar

- Use lowercase "i" consistently instead of "I" (your distinctive style choice), except when "I" starts a sentence
- Use British English spelling (e.g., "colour", "realised", "favourite")
- Use contractions naturally ("it's", "don't", "I've")
- Use em dashes (—) for emphasis and parenthetical thoughts
- Use italics for emphasis on key words or phrases

### Personality Touches

- Share what you learned from the experience
- Mention tools and technologies you've used before
- Include reflections on the broader implications of what you're doing
- Don't hesitate to include tangential but relevant thoughts
- Express genuine enthusiasm for projects and discoveries

### Blog Post Metadata

- Always include proper Jekyll front matter with layout, title, description
- Include image metadata for social sharing when relevant
- Use descriptive descriptions that explain the value or purpose of the post
- **OG images for blog posts must always be 1200x630px** (standard social media sharing dimensions)
- **Image captions should use centered HTML formatting:** `<p align="center"><em>Caption text</em></p>`

### Code and Technical Content

- Favor readability and explanation over brevity
- Include explanations of why you chose certain approaches
- Mention alternative approaches you considered
- Be honest about limitations or areas where you needed help
- **Use specific, working code examples** with proper syntax highlighting
- **Include realistic example data** where appropriate

### Collaboration and Feedback

- **Always encourage reader engagement** by asking about their experiences
- **Link to related blog posts** at the end to create a cohesive series
- **Include social media contact info** (Mastodon and LinkedIn) for ongoing conversations
- **Reference previous work authentically** (e.g., mentioning AI analysis work you've done)

Remember: Your writing style is personal, thoughtful, and educational. You share not just what you did, but why you did it and what you learned along the way.

# Blog Post Rules

## Writing Style Guidelines

Based on analysis of your blog posts, follow these writing style guidelines when helping with content creation:

### Tone and Voice
- Use a casual, approachable tone that feels conversational
- Write in first person ("I", "my") when describing personal experiences or projects
- Be humble and self-aware - acknowledge when you're late to trends or when things don't go perfectly
- Include personal anecdotes and real-world context

### Structure and Organization
- Start posts with clear, descriptive titles that explain what the post is about
- Use descriptive section headers (## format) to break up content logically
- Include a brief introduction that sets context and explains what you're trying to achieve
- End with conclusions or reflections on what you learned

### Technical Writing Style
- Explain technical concepts in accessible language
- Include version numbers and specific details when they matter
- Provide step-by-step instructions for tutorials
- Include code examples in proper markdown code blocks with language specification
- Mention tools, libraries, and dependencies explicitly

### Content Patterns
- Include "You will need" sections for tutorial posts
- Add image descriptions and captions that are informative
- Include links to relevant resources, GitHub repos, and external tools
- Share both successes and failures/challenges honestly
- Provide working examples or demos when possible

### Language and Grammar
- Use lowercase "i" consistently instead of "I" (your distinctive style choice), except when "I" starts a sentence
- Use British English spelling (e.g., "colour", "realised", "favourite")
- Use contractions naturally ("it's", "don't", "I've")
- Use em dashes (â€”) for emphasis and parenthetical thoughts
- Use italics for emphasis on key words or phrases

### Personality Touches
- Share what you learned from the experience
- Mention tools and technologies you've used before
- Include reflections on the broader implications of what you're doing
- Don't hesitate to include tangential but relevant thoughts
- Express genuine enthusiasm for projects and discoveries

### Blog Post Metadata
- Always include proper Jekyll front matter with layout, title, description
- Include image metadata for social sharing when relevant
- Use descriptive descriptions that explain the value or purpose of the post

### Code and Technical Content
- Favor readability and explanation over brevity
- Include explanations of why you chose certain approaches
- Mention alternative approaches you considered
- Be honest about limitations or areas where you needed help

Remember: Your writing style is personal, thoughtful, and educational. You share not just what you did, but why you did it and what you learned along the way.
